// Purpose: VCR mode records a client's game and allows you to
// play it back and reproduce it exactly. When playing it back, nothing
// is simulated on the server, but all server packets are recorded.
//
// Most of the VCR mode functionality is accomplished through hooks
// called at various points in the engine.
