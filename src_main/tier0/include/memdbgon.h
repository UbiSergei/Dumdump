// Purpose: This header, which must be the final include in a .cpp (or .h) file,
// causes all crt methods to use debugging versions of the memory allocators.
// NOTE: Use memdbgoff.h to disable memory debugging.

// SPECIAL NOTE! This file must *not* use include guards; we need to be able
// to include this potentially multiple times (since we can deactivate debugging
// by including memdbgoff.h)
