    Bink and Smacker were written by me, Jeff Roberts. I had lots of help, but,
    at the end of the day, I wrote them, I documented them, and I decided what 
    they do and what they don't. So, if you hate 'em, then it's my fault. But 
    if you like them, well, that's my fault too... Special thanks to Mitch 
    Soule, John Miles, Casey Muratori, Mike Sartain, Mike Abrash, and my wife,
    Alicia Fukunaga, someone I try to be more like. 

    Mark Engleberg and I did the original research work on Bink. David 
    Lawrence at Blizzard did much of the heavy lifting of porting Bink to 
    MacOS (and he tolerated many questions). Mike Sartain did the port to 
    GameCube and wrote several of the Xbox examples. Mike Sartain also got 
    the PS2 port up and running. Lee Powell, John Miles and Mike Abrash all 
    wrote YUV blitters over the years. David Etherton was also amazingly 
    helpful in getting the PS2 port wrapped up. Jason Dorie had the good idea 
    of using palettes with 3D hardware to do color conversion in hardware on 
    some older platforms. 

    Thanks also to Brian Kearney, Ken Coburn, Chris Hecker, Access Software, 
    Microsoft (both for the nice tools and the tough competition), and all 
    our Bink and Smacker licensees. 

    RAD's automatic documentation system was written by Casey Muratori. 

    Thanks to AMD for their kind support during the development of Bink for
    Windows 64!

    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
    ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
    but is also freely distributable.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
    support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
    to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
    algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
    by all standard GIF decoders.
